- ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone!
     Welcome to my GitHub, my name is Daisy and I'm a recent graduate looking to break into the tech industry via Data Analytics.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything related to sociology and culture from entertainment to food to social trends.
- ðŸŒ± Just completed learning SQL and Phython at an intermediate level through a 16-weeks bootcamp idiated to promote black females working within the tech industry.
- ðŸ“« Please feel free to reach me on a.daisy.brown@gmail.com if you have any suggestion or questions you'd like to ask.


The purpose of this project is to showcase SQL and data visualisation skills via Tableau.

I have chosen a marketing analytics project, as it is my preferred industry, and performed a RFM analysis to identify existing customers who are most likely to respond to a new offer.
